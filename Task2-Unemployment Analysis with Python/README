## 📘 Introduction

Unemployment analysis is a crucial task for understanding economic trends, identifying regions or demographics with high unemployment rates, and devising strategies to address these issues. Using Python, one can leverage powerful libraries and tools to analyze, visualize, and interpret unemployment data effectively.

Python offers a comprehensive ecosystem for data analysis, including:
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels** – Statistical modeling and analysis

These tools enable analysts to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from unemployment datasets.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to perform a **comprehensive analysis of unemployment in India using Python**. The analysis aims to:

- Shed light on the factors contributing to unemployment rate changes
- Identify state-wise patterns and trends
- Assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment
- Generate **actionable recommendations** for economic recovery and labor policy

## 📝 Problem Statement

Unemployment is a critical economic indicator, quantified by the unemployment rate – the proportion of jobless individuals within the labor force. The **COVID-19 pandemic** severely impacted the global labor market, triggering a spike in unemployment rates. Understanding these dynamics through data science can help policymakers craft better strategies and solutions.
